# Google Sheet Web Component [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-google-sheet/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-google-sheet/tree/master)

## Introduction

`rise-google-sheet` is a Polymer Web Component that works with [Rise Vision](https://www.risevision.com/), the digital signage management application for [Web Designers](http://risevision.com/web-designers). It retrieves data from a Google Sheet specified by key. It uses the cell-based feed feature of the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/) where each entry represents a single cell.

The `key` attribute is required which is to identify the Google Sheet you want to target. A spreadsheet's key can be found in the URL when viewing it in Google Docs (e.g. docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/< KEY >/edit#gid=0).

The specified feed is periodically retrieved if the `refresh` attribute is set, although a minimum refresh time of 10 seconds is enforced.

### Range
`rise-google-sheet` allows for fetching specific rows or columns from a worksheet by providing several attributes to specify the range of cells you want to retrieve.

For example, to retrieve cells for every row after the first row, and only in the fourth column, add the following attributes below:

```
<rise-google-sheet key="abc123" min-row="2" min-column="4" max-column="4"></rise-google-sheet>
```

## Usage
To use the Google Sheet Web Component, you should first install it using Bower:
```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-google-sheet.git
```

Next, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents-lite.min.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the web component using an HTML Import. For example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-google-sheet/rise-google-sheet.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <rise-google-sheet
      key="abc123"
      min-row="2"
      refresh="30"></rise-google-sheet>

    <script>
      // Wait for 'WebComponentsReady'.
      window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', function(e) {
        var sheet = document.querySelector('rise-google-sheet');

        // Respond to events it fires.
        sheet.addEventListener('rise-google-sheet-response', function(e) {
          if (e.detail && e.detail.cells) {
            console.log(e.detail.cells); // Array of cell objects
          }
        });

        sheet.go(); // Executes a request.
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

`rise-google-sheet` returns an Array of cell objects that the Sheets API has provided. It uses the cell-based feed feature of the API where each entry represents a single cell.

For more detail on the format of cell objects see ["Working with cell-based feeds"](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/#working_with_cell-based_feeds_1).

## Built With
- [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve)

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.
* [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - A simple web server for using bower components locally.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the web component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.
- [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - To install Polyserve, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g polyserve`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g polyserve`.

The web components can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-google-sheet.git
cd web-component-rise-google-sheet
npm install
bower install
```

### Run Locally
To access the demo locally, run the following command in Terminal: `polyserve`

Now in your browser, navigate to: 

```
localhost:8080/components/rise-google-sheet/demo/index.html
``` 

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests either by command terminal or via a local web server using Polyserve. 

#### Command Terminal
Execute the following command in Terminal to run tests:

```
gulp test
```

#### Local Server
Run the following command in Terminal: `polyserve`.

Now in your browser, navigate to: 

```
localhost:8080/components/rise-google-sheet/test/index.html
```

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy the contents of the `bower_components` folder to a folder on your server and also create a `rise-google-sheet` folder within your folder and upload `rise-google-sheet.html` to it. You can then use the web component by following the *Usage* instructions.
